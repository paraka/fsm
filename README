= ABOUT =
This is a very simple Finite State Machine example which can be perfectly used for event driven development in embedded systems.

= COMPILE =

* Create a build directory

$ mkdir build

* exec 'cmake'

$ cd build && cmake ..

* type 'make'

$ make

= USAGE =

Shift pressed event is emulated with '^' and shift release is emulated with '6'.
To end the infinite loop just type '.'.

= THANKS = 
Thanks to barrgroup for inspiration in such as simple code.
